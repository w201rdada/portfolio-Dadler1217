## So many dating apps!

Many of those seeking love, long term relationships, or simple companionship have embarked on the dating app quest. As millienials, we are very comfortable with phone apps and internet technology, even when it comes to our love lives. We start with downloading the app, filling out profiles about ourselves, and then begin the endless swiping, hoping that the same person who we swipe "yes" on likes us back. So often the game we play ends with someone not wanting the same things as we do, completely ignoring us, which is more commonly referred to now as "ghosting" us, or simply not being compatible. 

What if there were a better way to find out who is right for you? What if there was an app that currated your current matches and future relationships based on who you were in your prior relationships? My idea is for the tons of dating apps including: Tinder, eHarmony, OkCupid, Bumble, PlentyOfFish, Hinge, Happn, Jswipe, Grindr, The League, Coffee Meets Bagel, Match, OurTime, and Jdate to become a bit smarter. These apps would have a software add on that would enable someone to discuss their relationship history, and get matches based off of past relationships.

## A better way to find love.

Many of the apps currently match on personality, lifestyle choices, hobbies, interests, etc., but so often a potential predictor to our relationship lifestyle should be past relationships. The app add on would ask individuals questions about their relationship history such as number of longterm relationships, why they ended, what they learned, common disagreements, etc. This information would not be forward facing, but simply behind the scenes working with the algorithm already in place in the app to display potential matches. Someone could also choose if they only want to see other individuals that have also opted in to this relationship add on feature, or if that would not matter to them.

The thought here would be that two people who have both been in longterm relationships may prefer to be matched with other people who have also been in these longer relationships. Others that have shortterm relationships or are self-proclaimed "commitment phobes" would likely fair far better with people that are not expecting something longterm right off the bat. The imbalance of different expectations that could potentially waste a lot of time would no longer be in the way. 

This app would also help be able to learn the preferences of the individuals. Pretty quickly into dating a new person, it can be fairly obvious what they are looking for, and if they are looking for the same things as you. After a couple of dates, if an individual wanted, they could rate their match with regards to similar relationship preferences. Then, the app could learn a bit more about if this was a good setup
