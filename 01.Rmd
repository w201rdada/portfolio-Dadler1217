## Oh my God--I cannot believe I just sent that.

Everyone in the corporate world today has made the mistake of hitting send too quickly, or sending the wrong email to the wrong recipient. You desperately try to recall the message scrolling through hundreds of Google articles in about 5 minutes, only to learn that it is nearly impossible. If all recipients use the same email software as you, and are all within the same company, you may have a shot. Otherwise, your only option is to send a scurried apology email. All of a sudden, the financial invoice, new business proposal, or data science model has just gone into the hands of the wrong person.

## We have an email recall solution for you!

Companies and/or individuals can opt into a secure app that can be implemented into all major email software. This app will allow users to recall an email from all recipients who have not yet seen the email. An Outlook user sending to a Gmail user in a different company no longer has to worry about the ability to recall an email.

This app will also be able to help companies and individuals be smarter about their emails as well. From the company's perspective, this app will monitor email/data usage, size of emails, # of emails per day, etc. so that companies can be smarter about their storage capabilities. Understanding email habits may also help companies implement features like Slack if they see many short emails bouncing back and forth; or companies may implement a mandatory two minute email delay to all outside recipients if they see the email recall feature being used often. Companies will be able to improve employee workflow and understand storage more clearly at the same time.

From an individual perspective, this app will also learn people's tendencies and where they may make mistakes. Currently, Gmail and Outlook both have features where if a user writes the word "attached", and nothing is attached to the email, the user gets a reminder. This app would help build in more reminder features over time such as reminding someone to put a signature when sending to folks where they usually have a signature; or making sure the recipient name at the top matches the email address.

## Our big blunders on email are no more!

Over time, the secure app will help everyone live less worried about mistakes in this new age of hyper email activity, collect data from the company point of view, and help individuals send smarter emails.

A counter-argument could be that users or companies and individuals may be uncomfortable with anything being attached to their email and able to understand the content. Recipients may be anxious about the fact that an app can essentially go inside their inbox and remove an email. However, this service would be opted into and not automatic, and the sender would still have a copy of the email. 

If many millenials and Gen Xers can be comfortable with online bill pay, mobile device payment transfers, and in depth budgeting apps, this app does not seem like a far streth. Consumers are learning to trust app security as it helps their lives more and more. Users will likely come to love the features of the email recall and the corresponding poka-yolks (mistake-proofing) that come from understanding email habits.
