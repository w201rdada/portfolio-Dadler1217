### Abstract of my first cool idea {-}

Have you ever sent the wrong email to the wrong person? Have you ever realized that you sent a confidential file to the wrong client with no option to recall? If so, then this software is for you! My Big Idea is to create an email software that helps users avoid common mistakes. This technology would prompt users if the recipient name does not match the email address, if the file attachment name does not match the recipient client name, or if a curse word somehow sneaked into the email. The technology would also help companies with a summary of tonality and various other aspects of email to make sure that professionalism was paramount. Overall, this email add-on will be able to mistake proof all emails from here on out!
