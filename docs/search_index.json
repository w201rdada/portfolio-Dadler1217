Welcome to my Research Design and Applications for Data and Analysis portfolio! (#fig:Danielle_Adler)Hi Everyone! Abstract of my first cool idea Have you ever sent the wrong email to the wrong person? Have you ever realized that you sent a confidential file to the wrong client with no option to recall? If so, then this software is for you! My Big Idea is to create an email software that helps users avoid common mistakes. This technology would prompt users if the recipient name does not match the email address, if the file attachment name does not match the recipient client name, or if a curse word somehow sneaked into the email. The technology would also help companies with a summary of tonality and various other aspects of email to make sure that professionalism was paramount. Overall, this email add-on will be able to mistake proof all emails from here on out! Abstract of my second cool idea Have you ever wondered what predicts relationship success? Could it be past relationships? My research hypothesis and software app add-on tries to prove that past relationships are worthwhile predictors of future relationships. Dating app users will have the option to fill out a short questionaire about their past dating and relationship lifestyle. The app’s algorithm will use the answers to match up folks that have had similar dating experiences in a hope that they will be looking for the same thing. Users will then provide feedback on whether the match worked or not, which will prove or disprove our key research question and help the software. Overall, this dating app software add-on should improve the lives of all users!

["EmailEffectiveness.html", "1 Relieving the Panic of Hitting Send 1.1 Oh my God–I cannot believe I just sent that. 1.2 We have an email solution for you! 1.3 Our big blunders on email are no more!", " 1 Relieving the Panic of Hitting Send Keywords email, recall, oh no, what just happened, panic, wrong recipient, data science for email, lets get smarter 1.1 Oh my God–I cannot believe I just sent that. Everyone in the corporate world today has made the mistake of hitting send too quickly, or sending the wrong email to the wrong recipient. You desperately try to recall the message scrolling through hundreds of Google articles in about 5 minutes, only to learn that it is nearly impossible (Pinnington 2010). If all recipients use the same email software as you, and are all within the same company, you may have a shot. Otherwise, your only option is to send a scurried apology email and hope the recipient deleted the sometimes highly confidential information. Not only are you not able to recall, emails rarely prompt you to fix a potential mistake with a sender name, or even make you aware of large errors before you wind up hitting send. All of a sudden, the financial invoice, new business proposal, or data science model has just gone into the hands of the wrong person, potentially costing the company millions. My idea is to create a new, revolutionary software that enables users to recall messages, analyzes user patterns to send smarter, more effective emails, and allows corporations to understand employee email habits. 1.2 We have an email solution for you! Companies and/or individuals can opt into a secure plugin that can be implemented into all major email software. This add-on will allow users to recall an email from all recipients who have not yet seen the email and allow users to understand their habits with smart email technology, prompting appropriate word choice and sender names based on email content. From an individual perspective, this technology will learn user tendencies and where they may make mistakes. Currently, Gmail and Outlook both have features where if a user writes the word “attached”, and nothing is attached to the email, the user gets a reminder. By the same token, if the attachment states the word “Apple”, but the user address says “IBM”, another important reminder will get fired. This software would sort through all of the unstructured data within emails to develop patterns to understand what users say to whom, the tone they take, and their general word choices. The same person would likely send a very different email to a good friend at the company versus a prospective client. The user would also be able to state “yes” or “no” to specific prompts, which would develop a feedback loop, allowing the users’ individual email technology to get smarter and more customized. Overtime the software would learn user preferences and create built-in reminder features such as prompting someone to put a signature when sending to colleagues where they usually have a signature, or making sure the recipient name at the top of the email matches the email address. (Wong 2015) From the company’s perspective, this technology will monitor email/data usage, size of emails, # of emails per day, etc. so that companies can be smarter about their storage capabilities. Understanding email habits may also help companies implement features like Slack if they see many short emails, informal emails bouncing back and forth. Moreover, companies will be able to understand how their employees are communicating with each other and clients through weekly trend summaries of tone, # of emails, etc. and not specific emails. The “too tough” manager might be pulled aside before the employee complaint or resignation just based on the language that he is using in his emails to subordinates. The “almost defected” client could be managed better as well by making sure that the email language is overly friendly and accommodating. In today’s corporate world, all communication is important, and being able to communicate smarter and more effectively is imperative to success. 1.3 Our big blunders on email are no more! Over time, the secure email add-on will help everyone be less anxious about mistakes in this new age of hyper email activity, collect data from a company point of view, and guide individuals to send smarter emails. A counter-argument could be that users may be uncomfortable with anything being attached to their email which is able to understand the content. Recipients may be worried about the fact that software can essentially go inside their inbox and remove an email. However, this service would be opted into by a company or individual. While the software would technically be able to “read” email, it will be programmed to help the user and will be personalized over time. Ideally, the service would be a potential opt-in feature when creating simple email accounts like Gmail or Outlook to make implementation simple. If many millennials and Gen Xers can be comfortable with online bill pay, mobile device payment transfers, and in-depth budgeting apps, this software does not seem like a far stretch. Consumers are learning to trust app security as it helps their lives more and more. Companies or individuals could also set preferences to not have the email add-on for highly confidential information as well. All users will likely come to love the features of this software and the corresponding poka-yolks (mistake-proofing) that come from understanding email habits. Bibliography "],
["MatchMade.html", "2 My Side of the Story 2.1 So many dating apps! 2.2 A better way to find love. 2.3 Will this really work?", " 2 My Side of the Story 2.0.1 A software to help you find your mate based on your past experiences Keywords afraid of commitment, not another dating app, finding my soulmate, compatibility, making it work, dating app software 2.1 So many dating apps! Many of those seeking love, long-term relationships, or simple companionship have embarked on the dating app quest. Millennials are among the most common users as they are very comfortable with phone apps and internet technology, even when it comes to their love lives as over a quarter have used dating apps (Shively 2017). They start with downloading an app of choice and filling out profiles about themselves. Then, begin the endless swiping, hoping that the same person they swipe “yes” to likes them back. So often the game ends in failure with someone not wanting the same things as the other person. One person can completely ignore the other, which is more commonly referred to now as “ghosting”, or simply not be compatible. What if there were a better way to find out who is right for you? What if there were an app that curated your current matches and future relationships based on who you were in your prior relationships? My idea is for the tons of dating apps including: Tinder, eHarmony, OkCupid, Bumble, PlentyOfFish, Zoosk, Hinge, Happn, Jswipe, Christian Mingle, BlackPeopleMeet, Grindr, The League, Coffee Meets Bagel, Match.com, Cowboys Nearby, HowAboutWe, ChocolateSingles, MeetMe, Badoo, The League, Her, OurTime, FarmersOnly, and Jdate to become a bit smarter. These apps would each be able to give users the option of using a software add-on that would enable someone to discuss their relationship history, and get matches based off of past relationships. Each app could curate the questions a bit differently, or certain apps could consider working together to share user information as many are owned by the same parent company, the Match Group (Entis 2015). Figure 2.1: All the apps! 2.2 A better way to find love. Many of the dating apps on the market currently match on personality, lifestyle choices, hobbies, interests, etc., but the current dating app algorithms may be lacking (Weiss 2017). A potential predictor of our dating lifestyle could be past relationships. What effect, if any, do prior relationships have on future ones? My hypothesis is that someone’s prior relationships directly impact their future ones, and what they may determine is a successful relationship. This software helps us define the hypothesis by first asking people questions about their dating and relationship history such as number of long-term relationships, time they lasted, why they ended, what they learned, common disagreements, etc. The specific relationship sequencing and additional factors of dating and relationships would not be in play yet to keep sample sizes as large as possible. This information would not be frontward facing to potential mates, but simply behind the scenes working with the algorithm already in place in the app to display potential matches. Someone could also choose if they only wanted to see other individuals that have also opted in to this relationship add-on feature or not. The thought here would be that two people who have both been in long-term relationships may prefer to be matched with other people who have also been in longer relationships. Others that have been in many short-term relationships or are self-proclaimed “commitment phobes” would likely fair far better with people that are not expecting something long-term either. The imbalance of different expectations that could potentially waste a lot of time would no longer be in the way. This software would be able to help prove out the hypothesis of past relationships predicting future ones through user feedback. Pretty quickly into dating a new person, it can be fairly obvious what they are looking for, and if they are looking for the same things as you. After a couple of dates, an individual would be prompted within the app or over email to rate their match on relationship expectations. Questions such as, “was this person a good fit for you?” or “were they looking for the same type of relationship as you?” would help us determine if past relationships could be predictors of the future. If someone states that their recent date is looking for the same type of relationship, but their date had different prior relationship preferences, past behavior may not predict future relationship behavior. After a couple of months of dating, someone would be asked these same type of questions again as a follow up to see if they agree with their original thought process, or if more time is needed to understand their suitor. Looking at time intervals will be imperative to this study as well to see how long people need to really understand their suitor. Ideally, we will be able to begin to understand potential predictors of successful relationships, which could save a lot of time and energy for individuals looking for love in the future. 2.3 Will this really work? One of the most common points of contention that this new add-on feature may prohibit is the idea that someone may want to pivot from the type of relationship that they have had in the past. Someone may have had many short-term flings or one-night stands in college, and is now looking for something more serious. Or, someone else may have just gotten out of a long-term relationship and is now looking for something more casual. Luckily, the software within the app will be able to adapt to user feedback. In fact, the software will encourage user feedback and further curation. If users would like a “pivot” feature and would like to be setup with folks that have had different types of relationships prior, that could work too. Successful relationships out of the potential “pivot” feature could negate our hypothesis of past relationships predicting future ones, but could lead to happy users. Another inhibitor to this working solution is that consumers lie. Even when nobody is looking over your shoulder to check the information that you put into the dating app, users could still lie over embarrassment or not wanting to be honest with themselves. However, in any data science experiment dealing with vulnerable consumer information, the risk of false information is always apparent. The quantity should be able to take out most of the noise, and we will still be able to prove or disprove our hypothesis. My goal is that we can make the plethora of dating apps smarter to aid successful relationships so that people will be able to find what they are looking for more efficiently. With user feedback and further proving or disproving of the hypothesis, we will be able to understand more about what predicts future relationships and aid people’s experiences. Bibliography "],
